## Description

This is a Prework Study Guide website created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and using Git for version control. It was created to learn the basics of the technologies and workflows that will be used during this bootcamp period. I built this project to refresh myself on the whole process of building a viable product with a developer mindset while familiarizing myself with technologies and mindsets that I hadn't learned yet.

This project solves the problem of creating a study guide that not only contains information to study, it also demonstrates behavior that is evidence of a successful application of the study.

Ultimately, I learned that there indeed is a smooth process to software and web development from initial understanding and implementation, to revision and debugging, and to deploying. I no longer have to panic over which approach would be the "most successful" and just focus instead on the practices demonstrated through these lessons.

## Usage

The website contains information pertaining to each heading, so for the HTML heading for instance, notes taken relevant to that are listed underneath that heading. Additional information is shown in the DevTools console, where a successful listing of topics as well as which one to study will display.
